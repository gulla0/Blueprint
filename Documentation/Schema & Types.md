# **Documentation: Understanding the CIP-57 Schema and Types**

This document serves as an in-depth guide to the Zod schemas (schema.ts) and TypeScript types (types.ts) used in this application. Its purpose is to explain how we validate raw plutus.json files and transform them into a reliable format for generating Cardano artifacts.

## **Introduction: What's a plutus.json file?**

A plutus.json file is a blueprint generated by a Plutus compiler (like Aiken or Plutarch). It contains all the information needed to understand and use a smart contract on the Cardano blockchain. This includes the compiled code, its structure, and metadata like its title and version.

**The Problem:** These JSON files can be complex and might not always follow the expected structure. If we just assume the data is correct, our application could crash or produce invalid results.

**The Solution:** We use a two-step process to handle this:

1. **Schema (schema.ts):** A strict "rulebook" to validate the incoming plutus.json file. If the file doesn't follow the rules of the CIP-57 standard, we reject it.  
2. **Types (types.ts):** A clean, predictable, and "ideal" internal language for our application. Once data passes validation, we convert it into these reliable types to work with.

## **Part 1: The Schema (schema.ts) \- The Rulebook**

This file defines the rules for a valid plutus.json file. We use a library called **Zod** to build our validator. Think of Zod as a bouncer at a club: it checks every piece of incoming data to make sure it meets our strict criteria.

### **Core Concepts**

* **Cip57DataType**: The fundamental data types in Plutus. Our schema ensures that any data described in the blueprint is one of these:  
  * integer: A whole number (can be positive or negative).  
  * bytes: A sequence of raw bytes, usually represented as a hexadecimal string (e.g., "deadbeef").  
  * list: An ordered collection of other data items.  
  * map: A collection of key-value pairs.  
  * constructor: A complex data structure with an index and a list of fields, similar to an object or a struct in other languages.  
* **Cip57Purpose**: This describes *how* a smart contract script is intended to be used in a transaction.  
  * spend: To unlock and spend a UTXO from a script address.  
  * mint: To mint or burn a token.  
  * withdraw: To withdraw rewards from a staking address.  
  * publish: To publish a reference script on-chain.

### **The Code Explained**

#### **Cip57Schema**

This is the heart of the validator. It's a complex, **recursive** schema, meaning it can contain itself (e.g., a list can contain another list).

* **z.lazy()**: This is how we handle recursion. It tells Zod, "The full definition of this schema will be available later," which prevents an infinite loop.  
* **General Keywords**: title, description, $comment are optional metadata fields.  
* **Type-Specific Keywords**: We enforce rules to ensure keywords are only used with their correct dataType. For example, maxLength (which measures bytes) can *only* be used if dataType is "bytes".  
* **.superRefine()**: This is our "expert bouncer." After the basic checks pass, .superRefine() performs complex, context-aware checks. For instance, it verifies that if dataType is "constructor", then the index and fields properties **must** be present.

#### **Cip57ArgSchema**

A smart contract needs arguments to run, just like a function in programming. This schema defines the structure for those arguments (redeemer, datum, and parameters).

* **oneOf Logic**: An argument can have multiple forms depending on the purpose. For example, a single redeemer might have a different structure for minting versus spending. The schema validates this oneOf structure and uses .superRefine() to enforce a critical rule from CIP-57: the purpose for each branch in a oneOf **must be unique**. This uniqueness allows us to know exactly which schema to use just by looking at the transaction's purpose.

#### **Cip57BlueprintSchema**

This is the top-level schema that represents the entire plutus.json file.

* **preamble**: Contains metadata about the project, like its title, version, and the compiler used to create it.  
* **validators**: This holds the list of actual smart contracts. We cleverly support both an object and an array here, as different compilers format this field differently. This makes our app more robust.  
* **definitions**: A place to store reusable schema components, helping to keep the blueprint DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## **Part 2: The Types (types.ts) \- The Application's Internal Language**

After the bouncer (schema.ts) has approved the incoming data, we need a clean and reliable way to work with it inside our application. That's what this file is for. It defines the "perfect" structure of our data.

### **Schema vs. Types**

The **schema** is the *rulebook for external data*. The **types** are the *language for our internal logic*.

By separating them, we ensure the rest of our application doesn't have to worry about messy, optional, or oddly formatted data. It can trust that the data it receives matches these perfect types.

### **The Code Explained**

#### **PlutusVersion... Types**

* **The Problem**: A plutus.json file might specify the Plutus version as "v1", "v2", or "v3". However, Cardano's core libraries often expect a stricter format like "PlutusV1".  
* **The Solution**: We define three types to handle this gracefully:  
  * PlutusVersionBlueprint: A flexible type that accepts common variations.  
  * PlutusVersionWire: The strict, official format for Cardano libraries.  
  * PlutusVersionNorm: A clean, normalized version ("V1", "V2") that we use internally for consistency.

This pattern makes our code resilient to variations in the input data.

#### **NormalizedValidator**

This is a key type for making our application logic simple. The validators in plutus.json can be an array or an object, and the validator's name might be an object key.

The NormalizedValidator type represents a clean, predictable structure. We transform the raw data into a simple array of these objects, where each validator has a guaranteed name and a pre-calculated list of its purposes. This saves us from writing complicated logic later on.

#### **BuildOptions and ScriptArtifacts**

These types define the inputs and outputs for our final, critical function: generating the on-chain artifacts.

* **BuildOptions**: A single, clean object that bundles all the necessary "ingredients" to build a script address. This includes the network (Mainnet or Testnet) and optional staking key information.  
* **ScriptArtifacts**: A single object that represents the "final product." It contains everything you need to use the script:  
  * scriptCbor: The compiled code in its final, on-chain format.  
  * scriptHash: The unique identifier for the script.  
  * scriptAddress: The final, bech32-encoded address for the smart contract.

By having clear input and output types, our artifact generation logic becomes predictable, testable, and easy to use.
